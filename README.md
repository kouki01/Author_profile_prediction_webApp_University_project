Bloger author prediction

This is a web application that classify texts through a trained naive bayesian classifier. 

The user will be asked to provide a text or a blog url or a blogger id and the system will provide a prediction of the age and the gender of the
author. This will enable the public to provide us with a feedback about the prediction and help us improve our classifier.

This application is developed with Django Web framework that manages interaction between the python code, a database and web page templates. 

The classifier is trained on the PAN dataset and generated using a number of features (the project could be found [here](https://github.com/kouki01/Text_Mining_University_Project)).
